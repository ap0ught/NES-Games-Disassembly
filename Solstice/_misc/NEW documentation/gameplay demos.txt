Gameplay demos explained.


tbl_BAB2:
Theres the starting rooms for each one, 6 plus one unused.

tbl_BAB9:
In which exit Shadax appears at, same order as above. Uses same format as keys/detonators:

01 = bottom-left
02 = bottom-right
04 = top-right
08 = top-left 

tbl_BAC0_lo: & tbl_BAC7_hi:
Pointers, you dont need to touch these

And below that are the input data for each demo, two bytes for each command.

$FE = wait/stop, followed by how long to wait for.
$FF = ends the sequence.

Then either direction or button, using same format as "ram_buttons", followed by how long to travel into that direction before next command,
the distance is reversed like on teleporters.

Button values:
Note, direction acts same as D-pad in-game.

$01	right,	 to bottom right
$02	left,	 to top left
$04	down,	 to bottom left
$08	up,	 to top right
$10	start,	 start game
$20	select,	 open sub menu
$40	B, 	 interact
$80	A, 	 jump

The timing is bit annoying to deal with and explain, and if Shadax cant travel the distance, then he'll keep running into the wall/block/sprite forever.
If Shadax dies, the room restarts(and music stops) and continues the sequence if Shadax hits the travel distance even if it goes completely wrong.

If you are having hard time getting the timing right, try using $XC as base and then increase or lower the X value by one which from my testing works best,
but its still pain in the ass to get right at first, increasing the X usually works, sometimes it takes few tires to get right, its weird at most time, 
especially if you try to do complex inputs.

A or B button commands dont need anything spefic for their second byte, the boots room is the only time the original game had anything besides $00 for them,
but from my testing it makes no difference what you type them as, and the other ones only uses $00 past the first one.
